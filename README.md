# KnowledgeGraph
A knowledge graph, also known as a semantic network, represents a network of real-world entities—i.e. objects, events, situations, or concepts—and illustrates the relationship between them.

A graph data structure consists of a finite set of vertices (also called nodes or points), where some pairs are connected through edges.

The text data is aggregated on the graph-based data structure.
In the knowledge graph, 
	Entities are represented by nodes, 
	where some pairs of the entities are related in some sense. These relations are represented by edges.
	
The different types of knowledge graphs are as follows:
	WordNet: This is a lexical database of semantic relations between words.
	ConceptNet: ConceptNet is a freely-available semantic network, designed to help computers understand the meanings of words that people use.
